# Food_restaurant
Pick and choose what food do you want to order, remove ingredients, etc...
If you don't want to read the code and understand and want to see the tl;dr version of it. Then here it is.
First, we make a Start.java which has Strings, Numbers, etc...
We import it to Menu2.java
We use the strings to tell the user to pick one of the food in the menu list
In the switch case, we pick one of the numbers that the user picked (with the help of scanner)
Ask the user if they want to remove the ingredient from the ingredient list when they are ordering (shows the ingredient list)
removes the ingredient list
prints out the price, the ingredient list, and tells the user that the food is ready (in insanely quick speed)
